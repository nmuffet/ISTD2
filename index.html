            <h3>Reducing Inequality</h3>
            <p>Too much of the world&rsquo;s wealth is held by a very small group of people. This often leads to
                financial and social discrimination. <strong>In order for nations to flourish, equality and prosperity
                    must be
                    available to everyone &ndash; regardless of gender, race, religious beliefs or economic
                    status.</strong> When
                every individual is self sufficient, the entire world prospers.</p>

            <p>The pandemic has set progress of this goal back by roughly 10 years. Inequality across the world has
                worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the gap between the wealthy and the poor within countries
                continues to widen, according to the latest World Inequality Report.</p>

            <p>The top 10% of the highest earners in the world now own 76% of all wealth, while the bottom 50% owns just
                2%. That translates to an average purchasing power, or buying power for an individual, of $4,100 for the
                bottom half of the world, and $550,900 for the top earners.</p>

            <p>The data confirms a trend of global inequality that has only increased in recent decades. The top .01%,
                or 520,000 adults in the world, now owns 11% of all wealth, up from 7% in 1995. The billionaires in the
                world own 3.5% of all wealth, as compared to .5% in 1995, according to the report.</p>

            <h3>Climate Action</h3>

            <p>Climate change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization. The effects are already
                visible and will be catastrophic unless we act now. Through education, innovation and adherence to our
                climate commitments, we can make the necessary changes to protect the planet. These changes also provide
                huge opportunities to modernize our infrastructure which will create new jobs and promote greater
                prosperity across the globe.</p>

            <p><strong>According to scientists, global emissions should be cut to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 in order
                    to
                    limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre -industrial levels.</strong></p>

            <p>Emissions from developed countries were approximately 6.2% lower in 2019 than in 2010, while emissions
                from 70 developing countries rose by 14.4% in 2014.</p>

            <p>Combatting the climate crisis requires us to rapidly transform the systems that propel our economy,
                including power generation, buildings, industry, transport, land use, and agriculture&mdash;as well as
                the immediate scale-up of technological carbon removal. The State of Climate Action 2021 identifies 40
                indicators across key sectors that must transform to address the climate crisis, and assesses how
                current trends will impact how much work remains to be done by 2030 and 2050 to deliver a zero-carbon
                world in time. It also outlines the required shifts in supportive policies, innovations, strong
                institutions, leadership and social norms to unlock change.</p>

        <p "quote">&ldquo;Institutions place tight constraints on what can happen. The CEO of ExxonMobil surely knows as
            much about global warming as you or I do, probably a lot more, at least if he reads the materials that come
            to him from his own scientists and engineers, and they&rsquo;ve known it for 50 years. . . Suppose a
            different individual CEO came in and said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s tell the population the truth. Let&rsquo;s
            tell them that we are destroying the prospects for organized human life on earth. Let&rsquo;s tell them that
            we are
            going to stop doing it. We&rsquo;re going to move to renewable energy, because we care about your
            grandchildren and ours.&rsquo; He would be out in five minutes.</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s part of the institutional structure. If you aren&rsquo;t maximizing profit and market share, you
            aren&rsquo;t going to stand. Of course, there is a point to criticizing individuals, but the real point is
            that, within the system, they don&rsquo;t have a lot of choices. Therefore, we have to ask, &lsquo;What is
            it
            about the structure of our institutions that is leading us in this direction?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="pull-quote">&ldquo;Therefore, we have to ask, ‘What is it about the structure of our institutions that is
        leading us in this direction?’&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>These issues are made up of systems.</h2>

    <div>
        <p>A system is a set of things&mdash;people, cells, molecules&mdash;interconnected in such a way that they
            produce their own pattern of behavior over time. It may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by
            outside forces. But the system&rsquo;s response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that
            response is seldom simple in the real world.&rdquo;</p>

        <p> Systems are difficult because they may not appear as &ldquo;wholes&rdquo;. Unlike an engine or a tornado or
            a human being, they may be hard to see all at once.</p>

        <p>They often dispersed in space, their &ldquo;system-ness&rdquo; experienced only over time, rendering them
            almost invisible. Or we may live within these systems seeing only a few individual parts, making the whole
            easy-to-overlook. We might call these &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; systems&mdash; or gossamer or ethereal or
            translucent systems.</p>

        <p> Systems thinking is a way of thinking that gives us the freedom to identify root causes of problems and see
            new opportunities.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="pull-quote">&ldquo;Pouring half the milk into a second pail gives you two smaller amounts of milk, but
        dividing the cow in half does not give you two smaller cows.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>The scale of these problems can be disheartening. Often it feels there is little we can do as individuals,</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Behind the scenes, many agents of change&mdash;at all organizational levels and in regions all over the
            world&mdash;are struggling. At the same time, we are far from meeting the social and environmental
            challenges of our day; we need to unlock more collaboration and more innovation. Finding ways to address the
            personal challenges change makers face is therefore important not only because it matters in and of itself,
            but also because it has the potential to drive more effective social change.</p>

        <p>Instead of rallying us, climate despair asks us to give up. In a 2009 study in the UK by researchers Saffron
            O'Neill and Sophie Nicholson-Cole, climate-related data visualizations were presented to test subjects who
            were urged, in fear-based terms, to take action or else. Most of the time these appeals produced
            &ldquo;denial, apathy, avoidance, and negative associations.&rdquo;; Ultimately, the researchers concluded,
            &quot;climate change images can evoke powerful feelings of issue salience but these do not necessarily make
            participants feel able to do anything about it; in fact, it may do the reverse.&rdquo;</p>
    </div>

    <h2>&#8230;and that few powerful individuals are to blame.</h2>

    <p> Most Americans who say there’s too much economic inequality in the country think the federal government and big
        business should play a role in reducing inequality. Smaller but sizable shares say state governments and wealthy
        individuals should have a lot of responsibility in this regard.</p>

    <h2>We may think that it’s up to institutions larger than ourselves to solve the issue, but in reality, we don’t
        trust them to do so.</h2>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>Now, capitalism is at the base of every successful economy and it balances supply and demand. It unlocks the
            higher fraction of human potential, and it&rsquo;s not going anywhere. But it needs to be reformed, because
            the way we measure what&rsquo;s valuable now ignores so-called &ldquo;negative externalities&rdquo; like
            pollution. It also ignores positive externalities like investments in education, health care, mental health
            care, family services. It ignores the depletion of resources like groundwater and topsoil, and the web of
            living species. And it ignores the distribution of incomes and net worth. So that we have &mdash; when GDP
            goes up, people cheer &mdash; two percent, three percent, wow, four percent, and they think,
            &lsquo;Great.&rsquo; But it is accompanied by vast increases in pollution, chronic underinvestment in public
            goods, the depletion of irreplaceable natural resources, and the worst inequality crisis we&rsquo;ve seen in
            more than 100 years that is threatening the future of both capitalism and democracy. So, we have to change
            it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&#8230;Any kind of large, integrated institutional information-processing unit can only see the kinds of
            information they can process. And the kinds of information they can process are things like this&mdash;
            standardized, quantified information.</p>

        <p>If our taste and our values and our interests are varying and wide, and plural and rich, the state
            can&rsquo;t see that. The state can&rsquo;t get a handle on my bizarre taste in the tabletop role-playing
            games. So &#8230; if the state wants to be able to process our cares and our values, it would really help if
            our cares and our values aligned with the kinds of things that the state can easily measure.</p>

    <h2>So how do we expect change to happen?</h2>

    <h2>Systems are made up of individuals. The goal of the individual shouldn’t be to create change but to inspire
        others. To be part of a pattern.</h2>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>The job of people like you, activists on the streets, people who are trying to change the world for the
            better, is to dismantle all of this stuff. It is to get people to see what is not that far from right in
            front of their eyes. None of it is very profound. You can talk about it to high school students. They often
            understand it better than graduate students at major universities, who have been more indoctrinated.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money measures something real and has real meaning
            (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of
            resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of Homo sapiens. One can
            “own” land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have

        <p>But there&rsquo;s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single
            individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales from
